```{r log}

log_big <- replicate(1000,
                     log(prod(1 + runif(12, 0, 0.5))))

hist(log_big)

plot(density(log_big))

```


```{r}
curve(dnorm(x,178,20), from = 100, to = 250)
```

```{r}
curve(dunif(x,0,50), from = 10, to = 60)
```

Sampling to get an idea of what our heights might look like:

```{r}
sample_mu <- rnorm(1e4, 178, 20)

sample_sigma <- runif(1e4, 0, 50)

prior_h <- rnorm(1e4, sample_mu, sample_sigma)

rethinking::dens(prior_h)
```

Playing around with the parameters of the priors to see how this effects the prior probability density of heights.
